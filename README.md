## Creating Art with Hardware 🤖✨🎨
#### Adventures in trying out new hardware, code, and creating art

This is a presentation/demo of my first hardware project, [Raspberry Pi Interactive LED Art project](https://github.com/traumverloren/rpi-unicorn-leds). This presentation goes over why I built it, how I built it, and includes a live demo!

This talk will be given at Codeland Conf 2017 in NYC.

I hope it inspires others to go outside their comfort zone, try new stuff whether it's unfamiliar languages or hardware, and make projects for no other reason than because they wanna!

This was created using [Reveal.JS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)!
